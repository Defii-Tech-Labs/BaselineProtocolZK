**Auth**

The `auth` folder contains several files and subfolders that work together to provide authentication functionality for the system.

**Contents of the Auth Folder**

1. `capabilities`: This subfolder contains capability classes that implement authentication-related functionality. Specifically, it contains the `LoginCommandHandler` class, which handles login requests.
2. `agent`: This subfolder contains agent classes that implement authentication-related functionality. Specifically, it contains the `AuthAgent` class, which provides authentication-related services.

**APIs**

The `auth` folder provides the following APIs:

1. **Login**: This API is handled by the `LoginCommandHandler` class and is responsible for authenticating users. It takes a `LoginCommand` object as input and returns a promise that resolves to an `access_token` string.

**Relationship to Other Modules**

The `auth` module is closely related to the `authz` module, as authentication is a prerequisite for authorization.

**Summary**

In summary, the `auth` folder is a critical component of the Baseline protocol, providing authentication functionality for the system. It contains several files and subfolders that work together to handle login requests and provide authentication-related services.

**Login Flow**

The login flow in the `auth` module works as follows:

1. The `LoginCommandHandler` class is called to handle the login request.
2. The `LoginCommandHandler` class uses the `AuthAgent` class to perform authentication checks.
3. If the authentication checks pass, the `LoginCommandHandler` class returns an `access_token` string.
