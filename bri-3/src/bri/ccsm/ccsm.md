**_CCSM Module Overview_**
The Consensus Controlled State Machine (CCSM) module is responsible for managing interactions with smart contracts on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The module also allows for other blockchains to be used, allowing for cross-chain interactions.It provides services for storing and retrieving anchor hashes, managing curves, and verifying proofs.

**Key Components:**

1. **Anchor Hash Management**: The `CcsmStorageAgent` class provides methods for storing and retrieving anchor hashes on the blockchain. Anchor hashes are used to link workstep instances to their corresponding smart contract states.
2. **Smart Contract Interaction**: The `EvmService` class provides methods for interacting with smart contracts on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This includes connecting to contracts, storing anchor hashes, and verifying proofs.
3. **Curve Management**: The `EvmService` class also provides methods for managing curves, which are used in zero-knowledge proof systems.
4. **Proof Verification**: The `EvmService` class provides a method for verifying proofs, which is used to ensure the integrity of data stored on the blockchain.

**Relation to Other Folders:**

Based on the provided context, here's a brief overview of the relation between the `Baseline/bri-3/src/bri/ccsm` folder and the `TransactionModule`:

1. **`Baseline/bri-3/src/bri/transactions`**: The `TransactionsModule` imports the `CcsmModule` from the `ccsm` folder and utilizes the `EvmService` class to interact with smart contracts on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Specifically, the `EvmService` class is used to store anchor hashes on the blockchain, linking transaction instances to their corresponding smart contract states. The `storeAnchorHash` method of the `EvmService` class is called by the `TransactionModule` to store anchor hashes. Additionally, the `verifyProof` method of the `EvmService` class is used by the `TransactionModule` to verify proofs, ensuring the integrity of data stored on the blockchain.
