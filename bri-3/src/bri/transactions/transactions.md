**Transactions**

The `transactions` folder is a critical component of the Baseline protocol, responsible for managing transactions and interacting with other modules to enable secure and private data exchange.

**Folder Structure**

The `transactions` folder contains the following subfolders and files:

- `agents`: Contains agent-related classes, such as `TransactionAgent` and `TransactionStorageAgent`, which handle transaction-related operations.
- `api`: Includes API controllers, DTOs (Data Transfer Objects), and error messages related to transaction management.
- `capabilities`: Holds command and query handlers for transaction-related operations, such as creating, updating, and deleting transactions.
- `models`: Defines transaction-related models, including `Transaction`, `TransactionStatus`, and `TransactionResult`.
- `transactions.module.ts`: The main module file that imports and exports various transaction-related modules and components.

**APIs and Endpoints**

The `transactions` folder provides several APIs and endpoints for managing transactions:

1. **Create Transaction**: `POST /transactions` - Creates a new transaction.
2. **Get All Transactions**: `GET /transactions` - Retrieves a list of all transactions.
3. **Get Transaction by ID**: `GET /transactions/:id` - Retrieves a transaction by its ID.
4. **Update Transaction**: `PUT /transactions/:id` - Updates an existing transaction.
5. **Delete Transaction**: `DELETE /transactions/:id` - Deletes a transaction.
6. **Verify Transaction Result**: `POST /transactions/:id/verify` - Verifies the result of a transaction.

**Relationship with Worksteps**

The `transactions` folder interacts with the `worksteps` module to execute transactions as part of a workstep. A workstep is a single step in a workflow that represents a specific task or operation. When a workstep is executed, it may involve the creation of a new transaction. The `TransactionAgent` class in the `transactions` folder is responsible for creating and managing transactions.

In particular, the `WorkstepType` enum in the `worksteps` module defines the different types of worksteps that can be executed, including `PAYLOAD_FROM_USER`, `PAYLOAD_FROM_API`, `BPI_TRIGGER`, and `BPI_WAIT`. The `transactions` folder uses this enum to determine the type of transaction to create and execute as part of a workstep.

For example, when a workstep of type `PAYLOAD_FROM_USER` is executed, the `TransactionAgent` class creates a new transaction with a payload from the user. Similarly, when a workstep of type `BPI_TRIGGER` is executed, the `TransactionAgent` class creates a new transaction with a payload from the BPI (Business Process Interface).

**Relationship with ZeroKnowledgeProof Module**

The `transactions` folder interacts with the `ZeroKnowledgeProof` module to enable secure and private transactions. The `ZeroKnowledgeProof` module uses cryptographic techniques, such as homomorphic encryption and zero-knowledge proofs, to verify the correctness of transactions without revealing sensitive information.

In particular, the `VerifyTransactionResult` API endpoint in the `transactions` folder uses the `ZeroKnowledgeProof` module to verify the result of a transaction. The `ZeroKnowledgeProof` module generates a zero-knowledge proof that the transaction was executed correctly, without revealing the underlying data.

The `ZeroKnowledgeProof` module uses the `CircuitInputsParserService` class to parse the inputs to the zero-knowledge proof circuit. The `CircuitInputsParserService` class is responsible for converting the transaction data into a format that can be used by the zero-knowledge proof circuit.

**Summary**

The `transactions` folder provides a comprehensive set of APIs and utilities for managing transactions, interacting with other modules to enable secure and private data exchange. The relationships between the `transactions` folder and other modules, such as `worksteps` and `ZeroKnowledgeProof`, demonstrate the complexity and sophistication of the Baseline protocol.

In the context of the Baseline protocol, the `transactions` folder plays a critical role in enabling secure and private transactions, and is a key component of the overall system.
