# Baseline Protocol for Cross-Jurisdictional Invoice Financing

## NGI TRUSTCHAIN Open Call 4 Project

A production-ready implementation of the Baseline Protocol enabling standardized, verifiable cross-border SME invoice financing between Serbian and Romanian markets through privacy-preserving zero-knowledge proofs and blockchain verification.

---

## üéØ Project Overview

### **Use Case: Cross-Border Invoice Portfolio Aggregation**

This project addresses the critical SME financing gap in Central and Eastern European markets by creating a standardized, verifiable process for invoice origination that enables portfolio aggregation across jurisdictions. The solution bridges the disconnect between fragmented local invoice financing companies and large debt providers seeking standardized, auditable investment opportunities.

### **Technology Readiness Level: TRL6**

- **Achieved**: Technology demonstrated in relevant environment using real-world data
- **Evidence**: End-to-end testing with genuine Serbian and Romanian invoice data formats, actual certificate structures, and real API response patterns from government systems
- **Validation**: Successful cross-BPI communication, zero-knowledge proof generation, and independent third-party verification

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### **Dual-BPI Implementation**

- **Serbian BPI**: Manages Serbian invoice origination with e-invoicing platform integration
- **Romanian BPI**: Handles Romanian invoice validation with business registry verification
- **Interoperability Layer**: Enables seamless cross-border data aggregation hosted within Serbian BPI

### **Key Technical Components**

#### **Multi-Chain Blockchain Support**

- **Primary**: Polygon, Avalanche (EVM-compatible)
- **Capability**: Cross-chain proof verification for independent auditing
- **Smart Contracts**: BPI State Anchor & Verifier contracts for proof storage

#### **Zero-Knowledge Proof System**

- **Custom Circom Circuits**: Validate Serbian/Romanian government certificate formats

## Project Structure

The project is structured into multiple directories, each serving a specific purpose:

- `bri-3/src/bri`: Main application codebase for the Baseline Protocol implementation

  1. `auth`: Authentication logic
  2. `authz`: Authorization policies and role management
  3. `ccsm`: Consensus Controlled State Machine for blockchain interactions. This allows for cross-chain interactions and verifies zero-knowledge proof using smart contracts.
  4. `communication`: Messaging and event handling using NATS
  5. `identity`: User management and DID authentication
  6. `state`: State management of BPISubjectAccounts as per workflow progress
  7. `transactions`: Transaction processing, including creation, execution, and verification of worksteps
  8. `vsm`: Virtual State Machine for queuing and processing transactions
  9. `workgroups`: Workgroup and workflow management, including workstep definitions (business logic) and transaction schemas
  10. `zeroKnowledgeProof`: Zero-knowledge proof generation and verification of business logic as defined in worksteps

- `docs`: Documentation related to the project, including architecture, API references, and integration guides
- `test`: End-to-end and unit test scripts and configurations
- `zeroKnowledgeArtifacts`: Pre-generated zero-knowledge proof artifacts for testing and development
- `docker`: Docker configurations and scripts for setting up the development and production environments
- `scripts`: Utility scripts for various tasks such as database seeding and migrations

---

**Technical Process**

The technical process for the Baseline Protocol implementation involves the following steps:

**Step 1: Generate Nonce + Login**

- The process starts with generating a nonce, which is a unique identifier used for authentication.
- The user logs in using their credentials, and the nonce is used to authenticate the user.

**Step 2: Create BPI Subject (Supplier & Buyer)**

- The user creates a BPI (Business Process Interface) subject for both the supplier and buyer.
- The BPI subject is created using the `createExternalBpiSubject` function, which takes in the subject's name and public key as input.
- The public key is used to authenticate the subject and ensure that only authorized parties can access the data.

**Step 3: Create BPI Subject Account (Supplier & Buyer)**

- Once the BPI subject is created, a BPI subject account is created for both the supplier and buyer.
- The BPI subject account is created using the `createBpiSubjectAccount` function, which takes in the subject's ID and public key as input.
- The BPI subject account is used to manage the subject's data and ensure that only authorized parties can access it.

**Step 4: Create "Origination" Workgroup**

- A workgroup is created for the origination process, which is used to manage the workflow and transactions.
- The workgroup is created using the `createWorkgroup` function, which takes in the workgroup's name and description as input.

**Step 5: Create Worksteps**

- Worksteps are created for each step in the origination process, such as creating a transaction and verifying the transaction result.
- The worksteps are created using the `createWorkstep` function, which takes in the workstep's name and description as input.

**Step 6: Create Workflow & Add Worksteps**

- A workflow is created to manage the origination process, which includes the worksteps created in the previous step.
- The workflow is created using the `createWorkflow` function, which takes in the workflow's name and description as input.
- The worksteps are added to the workflow using the `addWorkstepToWorkflow` function.

**Step 7: Add Transaction Schemas to Worksteps**

- Transaction schemas are added to each workstep to define the structure of the transaction data.
- The transaction schemas are added using the `addTransactionSchemaToWorkstep` function, which takes in the workstep's ID and transaction schema as input.

**Step 8: Create Transactions**

- Transactions are created for each workstep, which includes the transaction data and schema.
- The transactions are created using the `createTransaction` function, which takes in the workstep's ID, transaction data, and schema as input.

**Step 9: Check Transaction Execution**

- The transaction execution is checked to ensure that it was successful.
- The transaction execution is checked using the `checkTransactionExecution` function, which takes in the transaction's ID as input.

**Step 10: Verify Transaction Result on-chain (ZK Proof)**

- The transaction result is verified on-chain using a zero-knowledge proof (ZK proof).
- The ZK proof is used to ensure that the transaction result is correct and that the data has not been tampered with.
- The ZK proof is verified using the `verifyTransactionResultOnChain` function, which takes in the transaction's ID and ZK proof as input.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### **Prerequisites**

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Git
- Node.js 18+ (for development)

### **Local Development Setup**

```bash

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/NGI-TRUSTCHAIN/Baseline.git
cd Baseline
cd bri-3

# DB

$ docker run --name postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=example -p 5432:5432 -d postgres # start a postgres container
$ create a .env file based on the .env.sample # provide a connection string for the db instance
$ npm install # install project dependencies
$ npm run prisma:generate # generate the prisma client
$ npm run prisma:migrate:dev # migrate the db to latest state
$ npx prisma db seed # seed db

$ npx prisma migrate reset # reset the db to initial state, remove all data and apply seed

```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Test

```bash
# For manual testing, swagger is running on http://localhost:3000/api
# To get json format to use tools like postman, checkout http://localhost:3000/api-json

$ npm run start
```

```bash
# Unit testing - .spec files located next to the thing they are testing

$ npm run test

# Run single spec file
$ npm run test -- transactions.agent.spec.ts
```

```bash
# Use following commands to generate the zk artifacts for the origination e2e test case

$ cd Baseline/bri-3
$ PROTOCOL=plonk npm run snarkjs:circuit originationWorkgroup/serbia_workstep1
$ PROTOCOL=plonk npm run snarkjs:circuit originationWorkgroup/serbia_workstep2
$ PROTOCOL=plonk npm run snarkjs:circuit originationWorkgroup/serbia_workstep3
$ PROTOCOL=plonk npm run snarkjs:circuit originationWorkgroup/serbia_workstep4
$ PROTOCOL=plonk npm run snarkjs:circuit originationWorkgroup/romania_workstep1
```

NOTE: for above to work, make sure circom v2.1.9 is installed. If this [guide](https://docs.circom.io/getting-started/installation/#installing-dependencies) is followed for installation, after `git clone https://github.com/iden3/circom.git` execute `cd circom and git checkout v2.1.9`.

```bash
# e2e testing - .e2e.spec files and the bash script used for running located in ./test folder
# before running the tests, make sure that postgres and nats are running
# also make sure that the .env file contains correct values for DID login to work (as explained in the .env.sample)

$ cd test
$ sh ./e2e-test-sri.sh
$ sh ./e2e-test-origination.sh
```

For testing origination workflow, folder `zeroKnowledgeArtifacts` has to be present in `bri-3` as it is mounted as volume of docker containers.
This can be built manually with `plonk` as described above, but for convenience zip file is available and can be downloaded like this:

```
cd bri-3
rm -rf zeroKnowledgeArtifacts
curl -L https://zkartifacts.sfo3.digitaloceanspaces.com/zeroKnowledgeArtifacts.zip -o zeroKnowledgeArtifacts.zip
unzip -q zeroKnowledgeArtifacts.zip -d .
```

To run e2e tests with docker:

```bash
$ make test-sri
```

```bash
$ make test-origination
```

### make test-origination

This single command:

- Spins up complete dockerized infrastructure
- Executes Serbian and Romanian invoice validation workflows
- Demonstrates cross-BPI communication
- Validates zero-knowledge proof generation
- Simulates government API interactions

### **Local Environment Includes**

- PostgreSQL databases (Romanian & Serbian BPIs)
