# Baseline Protocol for Cross-Jurisdictional Invoice Financing

## NGI TRUSTCHAIN Open Call 4 Project

A production-ready implementation of the Baseline Protocol enabling standardized, verifiable cross-border SME invoice financing between Serbian and Romanian markets through privacy-preserving zero-knowledge proofs and blockchain verification.

---

## üéØ Project Overview

### **Use Case: Cross-Border Invoice Portfolio Aggregation**

This project addresses the critical SME financing gap in Central and Eastern European markets by creating a standardized, verifiable process for invoice origination that enables portfolio aggregation across jurisdictions. The solution bridges the disconnect between fragmented local invoice financing companies and large debt providers seeking standardized, auditable investment opportunities.

### **Technology Readiness Level: TRL6**
- **Achieved**: Technology demonstrated in relevant environment using real-world data
- **Evidence**: End-to-end testing with genuine Serbian and Romanian invoice data formats, actual certificate structures, and real API response patterns from government systems
- **Validation**: Successful cross-BPI communication, zero-knowledge proof generation, and independent third-party verification

---

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### **Dual-BPI Implementation**
- **Serbian BPI**: Manages Serbian invoice origination with e-invoicing platform integration
- **Romanian BPI**: Handles Romanian invoice validation with business registry verification  
- **Interoperability Layer**: Enables seamless cross-border data aggregation hosted within Serbian BPI

### **Key Technical Components**

#### **Multi-Chain Blockchain Support**
- **Primary**: Polygon, Avalanche (EVM-compatible)
- **Capability**: Cross-chain proof verification for independent auditing
- **Smart Contracts**: BPI State Anchor & Verifier contracts for proof storage

#### **Zero-Knowledge Proof System**
- **Custom Circom Circuits**: Validate Serbian/Romanian government certificate formats
- **Privacy-Preserving**: Verify invoice authenticity without exposing sensitive financial data
- **Jurisdiction-Specific**: Handle unique requirements while maintaining interoperability

#### **External System Integration**
- **Serbian E-Invoicing Platform**: API integration with government-signed responses
- **Romanian Business Registry**: Enhanced security through certificate validation
- **Multi-Format Support**: JSON and XML data processing for legacy ERP compatibility

## üöÄ Quick Start

### **Prerequisites**
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Git
- Node.js 18+ (for development)

### **Local Development Setup**
```bash

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/NGI-TRUSTCHAIN/Baseline.git
cd Baseline
cd bri-3

# DB

$ docker run --name postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=example -p 5432:5432 -d postgres # start a postgres container
$ create a .env file based on the .env.sample # provide a connection string for the db instance
$ npm install # install project dependencies
$ npm run prisma:generate # generate the prisma client 
$ npm run prisma:migrate:dev # migrate the db to latest state
$ npx prisma db seed # seed db

$ npx prisma migrate reset # reset the db to initial state, remove all data and apply seed

```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Test

```bash
# For manual testing, swagger is running on http://localhost:3000/api
# To get json format to use tools like postman, checkout http://localhost:3000/api-json 

$ npm run start
```

```bash
# Unit testing - .spec files located next to the thing they are testing

$ npm run test

# Run single spec file
$ npm run test -- transactions.agent.spec.ts
```
```bash
# Use following commands to generate the zk artifacts for the origination e2e test case

$ cd Baseline/bri-3
$ PROTOCOL=plonk npm run snarkjs:circuit originationWorkgroup/serbia_workstep1
$ PROTOCOL=plonk npm run snarkjs:circuit originationWorkgroup/serbia_workstep2
$ PROTOCOL=plonk npm run snarkjs:circuit originationWorkgroup/serbia_workstep3
$ PROTOCOL=plonk npm run snarkjs:circuit originationWorkgroup/serbia_workstep4
$ PROTOCOL=plonk npm run snarkjs:circuit originationWorkgroup/romania_workstep1 
```

NOTE: for above to work, make sure circom v2.1.9 is installed. If this [guide](https://docs.circom.io/getting-started/installation/#installing-dependencies) is followed for installation, after `git clone https://github.com/iden3/circom.git` execute `cd circom and git checkout v2.1.9`. 

```bash
# e2e testing - .e2e.spec files and the bash script used for running located in ./test folder
# before running the tests, make sure that postgres and nats are running
# also make sure that the .env file contains correct values for DID login to work (as explained in the .env.sample)

$ cd test
$ sh ./e2e-test-sri.sh
$ sh ./e2e-test-origination.sh
```

For testing origination workflow, folder `zeroKnowledgeArtifacts` has to be present in `bri-3` as it is mounted as volume of docker containers.
This can be built manually with `plonk` as described above, but for convenience zip file is available and can be downloaded like this:

```
cd bri-3
rm -rf zeroKnowledgeArtifacts
curl -L https://zkartifacts.sfo3.digitaloceanspaces.com/zeroKnowledgeArtifacts.zip -o zeroKnowledgeArtifacts.zip
unzip -q zeroKnowledgeArtifacts.zip -d .
```

To run e2e tests with docker:

```bash
$ make test-sri
```

```bash
$ make test-origination
```

### make test-origination

This single command:
- Spins up complete dockerized infrastructure
- Executes Serbian and Romanian invoice validation workflows
- Demonstrates cross-BPI communication
- Validates zero-knowledge proof generation
- Simulates government API interactions

### **Local Environment Includes**
- PostgreSQL databases (Romanian & Serbian BPIs)
- NATS messaging system
- Mock external APIs (business registries, e-invoicing platforms)
- Blockchain interaction layers
- Both BPI instances with full workflow support

## Messaging

Relevant information can be found in ./docs/nats/nats-configuration.md

## Environment configuration

Can be found in ./env.sample.

Relevant information on DID Auth can be found in ./docs/dids/did-authentication.md

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## CI

There are 3 workflows:

- `bri-3.yaml`

This workflow is checking if build, formatter, linter and unit tests are working. It is running on every commit on PR and push to main.

- `origination-tests.yaml`

This workflow is running origination e2e tests on self hosted github runner. It is running on every push to main.

- `deploy-staging.yaml`

This workflow is manually triggered. It will pull latest main branch on staging environment, clean up and redeploy all docker containers needed to run origination flow.
